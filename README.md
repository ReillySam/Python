Python Practice and Projects


My learning of OOP creating small games and systems like Hangman and Library/College system using Python. 
This learning led me to developing projects such as the Sorting Visualizer and TicTacToe AI edition.
I have also explored Python's vast libraries discovering other useful tools such as NumPy, SciKit learn, Pandas and more. These smaller projects have given me a taste 
of Machine Learning and data processing skills (MovieRecommender). With my statistical analysis background I thoroughly enjoyed this concept. Now, I look to explore these libraries further and strengthen my ML understanding.
